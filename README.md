# Aether ROC Development

This repository contains a Makefile and scripts for conveniently bringing up the Aether ROC
in a local development environment based on [k3d](https://k3d.io/).

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools on your development machine:
* Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* k3d: https://k3d.io/#installation
* kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
* Helm: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

## Bootstrap

Before bringing up the ROC for the first time, it's necessary to run:

```bash
make bootstrap       # download the Aether ROC Helm charts and their dependencies
```

## Bringing up the ROC

Here's a simple workflow for bringing up the ROC and populating some sample models:

```bash
source env.sh        # set a couple of environment vars
make k3d-cluster-up  # bring up a single-node k3d cluster
make aether-up       # install the Aether ROC
make demo-post       # load some sample models into the ROC
```

Descriptions of the important Makefile targets can be found in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).

## Interacting with the ROC

Assuming you have deployed the k3d cluster as described above, the ROC and ONOS are
available on localhost:
* ROC GUI: http://localhost:31190/
* ONOS GUI: http://localhost:31180/
* ROC API: http://localhost:31190/aether-roc-api/

### Interacting with the API via Swagger UI

The Swagger UI provides an easy way of visualizing and interacting with APIs.
Below are steps to configure Swagger UI in the cloud to interact with your local ROC API:
* Go to https://editor.swagger.io
* Select **File > Import URL**, point it to the raw version of the [aether-roc-api OpenAPI3 spec](https://github.com/onosproject/aether-roc-api/tree/master/api) that you want to import
* Select **Insert > Add Servers**, add the ROC API URL: http://localhost:31190/aether-roc-api/
* Go to an API call and click **Try it out**
* If using the **aether-1.0.0** OpenAPI spec, for **Target** enter **spgw-1**

You can also cut and paste the **curl** commands generated by Swagger UI into a local terminal.
